[[plugins-filters-yaml]]
=== yaml

NOTE: This plugin cannot be installed on the current version of Logstash.

This is a YAML parsing filter. It takes an existing field which contains YAML and
expands it into an actual data structure within the Logstash event.

By default it will place the parsed YAML in the root (top level) of the Logstash event, but this
filter can be configured to place the YAML into any arbitrary event field, using the
`target` configuration.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-filters-yaml-add_field]]
===== `add_field`

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        add_field => { "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}" }
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      yaml {
        add_field => {
          "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}"
          "new_field" => "new_static_value"
        }
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add field `foo_hello` if it is present, with the
value above and the `%{host}` piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-add_tag]]
===== `add_tag`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      yaml {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add a tag `foo_hello` (and the second example would of course add a `taggedy_tag` tag).

[[plugins-filters-yaml-enable_metric]]
===== `enable_metric`

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance
by default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection
for a specific plugin.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-id]]
===== `id`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a unique `ID` to the plugin instance, this `ID` is used for tracking
information for a specific configuration of the plugin.

```
output {
 stdout {
   id => "ABC"
 }
}
```

If you don't explicitely set this variable Logstash will generate a unique name.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-periodic_flush]]
===== `periodic_flush`

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Call the filter flush method at regular interval.
Optional.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-remove_field]]
===== `remove_field`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      yaml {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "my_extraneous_field" ]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name `foo_hello` if it is present. The second
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-remove_tag]]
===== `remove_tag`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      yaml {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the tag `foo_hello` if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well.

[[plugins-filters-yaml-source]]
===== `source`

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The configuration for the YAML filter:
[source,ruby]
    source => source_field

For example, if you have YAML data in the @message field:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        source => "message"
      }
    }

The above would parse the yaml from the @message field

[[plugins-filters-yaml-target]]
===== `target`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Define the target field for placing the parsed data. If this setting is
omitted, the YAML data will be stored at the root (top level) of the event.

For example, if you want the data to be put in the `doc` field:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      yaml {
        target => "doc"
      }
    }

YAML in the value of the `source` field will be expanded into a
data structure in the `target` field.

NOTE: if the `target` field already exists, it will be overwritten!
