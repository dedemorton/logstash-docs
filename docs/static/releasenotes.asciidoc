[[logstash-2-3-4]]
=== Logstash 2.3.4 Release Notes

[float]
==== Output Plugins

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* Fixed an issue where unnecessary information from HTTP headers was being logged. 

[[logstash-2-3-3]]
=== Logstash 2.3.3 Release Notes

* Fixed a bug where the dynamic config reload feature could use excessive amounts of memory, leading to a crash ({lsissue}5235[Issue 5235]).
* Fixed a bug where Logstash would not stop even when `KILL_ON_STOP_TIMEOUT` was specified ({lsissue}5427[Issue 5427]).

[float]
==== Input Plugins

*`TCP`*:

* Changed the log level of the SSLError for the handshake from `error` to `debug`.

*`RabbitMQ`*:

* Fixed the `ssl` option to be boolean again (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-rabbitmq/issues/82[Issue 82]).
* Added a separate `ssl_version` parameter.
* Marked the `verify_ssl` parameter as obsolete because it never worked.
* Added better checks for SSL argument consistency.

[float]
==== Filter Plugins

*`KV`*:

* Added `:transform_value` and `:transform_key` options to lowercase/uppercase or capitalize all keys/values.

*`XML`*:

* Added a new configuration option called `suppress_empty`. By default the filter creates an empty hash from empty
XML elements (`suppress_empty => false`). You can now set `supress_empty => true` so that the filter does not create
event fields from empty XML elements.
* Added a new configuration option called `force_content`. By default, the filter expands attributes differently for content in XML elements. This option allows you to force text content and attributes to always parse to a hash value.
* Fixed a bug that ensures that a target is set when storing XML content in the event (`store_xml => true`).

[float]
==== Output Plugins

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* Added a pipeline configuration option for setting an ingest pipeline to run upon indexing.

[[logstash-2-3-2]]
=== Logstash 2.3.2 Release Notes

* Added reload support to the init script so you can do `service logstash reload`.
* The original intent of `"%{foo}"` syntax was to always produce a string, but the previous 2.x and 1.5.x versions
returned a float (underlying value). Starting in release 2.3.0, Logstash returned the underlying value type for
field references. In 2.3.2 we are returning back to the 2.x and 1.5.x behavior of returning a float because changing
the behavior broke compatibility in a minor release ({lsissue}5114[Issue 5114]).
* Fixed use of the `KILL_ON_STOP_TIMEOUT` variable in init scripts, which allows Logstash to force stop ({lsissue}4991[Issue 4991]).
   
[float]
==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Fixed an issue encountered when the time-based flush feature was used with the multiline codec
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/73[Issue 73]).

*`HTTP Poller`*:

* Fixed the `ssl_certificate_validation` option so that it actually lets you disable cert validation 
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http_poller/issues/48[Issue 48]).

[float]
==== Filter Plugins

*`XML`*:

* Added a setting called `force_array` that when set to false prevents storing single elements in arrays
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-xml/issues/27[Issue 27]).

[float]
==== Output Plugins

*`Redis`*:

* Fixed a flood of runtime warnings that were logged when the Redis output was used (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-redis/issues/26[Issue 26]).

[[logstash-2-3-1]]
=== Logstash 2.3.1 Release Notes

* Reverted the new Java Event which shipped in 2.3.0. The new pure Java implementation of the Event class Logstash 2.3.1 lightning fast, but unfortunately not as compatible as weâ€™d have liked for a minor release. In particular, it could cause problems with some custom Ruby filter scripts and custom plugins from the community. We take our commitment to compatibility, and versioning semantics, seriously. Though we have reverted to the prior Ruby Event implementation, the Java version remains the correct technical direction and we will most likely be reintroducing in Logstash 5.0.
* Fixed a JRuby thread safety issue that was encountered when using regular expressions under multiple workers
({lsissue}4977[Issue 4977]).
* Disabled environment variables interpolation by default. This feature is experimental in Logstash 2.3.1. To turn it on use the `--allow-env` flag ({lsissue}4958[Issue 4958]). 
* Changed the Logstash shutdown process to hide sensitive data from the log when shutting down a stale Logstash
({lsissue}4952[Issue 4952]).
* Disabled the default behavior of outputting the Configuration AST when running Logstash in debug mode. Introduced the `--debug-config` flag to display the AST ({lsissue}4965[Issue 4965]).
* Fixed an error encountered when running Logstash with the `--config-test` flag ({lsissue}4933[Issue 4933]).
* Made filter conditionals work when running Logstash with automatic configuration reloading ({lsissue}4968[Issue 4968]).
* Fixed the stop command of the Ubuntu init script ({lsissue}4940[Issue 4940]).

[float]
==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Changed when the identity map is used. Now it's only used when the configuration specifies the multiline codec 
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/70[Issue 70]).


[[logstash-2-3]]
=== Logstash 2.3 Release Notes

* Added dynamic config, a new feature to track config file for changes and restart the 
  pipeline (same process) with updated config changes. This feature can be enabled in two 
  ways: Passing a CLI long-form option `--auto-reload` or with short-form `-r`. Another 
  option, `--reload-interval <seconds>` controls how often LS should check the config files 
  for changes. Alternatively, if you don't start with the CLI option, you can send SIGHUP 
  or `kill -1` signal to LS to reload the config file, and restart the pipeline ({lsissue}4513[Issue 4513]).
* Added support to evaluate environment variables inside the Logstash config. You can also specify a 
  default if the variable is not defined. The syntax is `${myVar:default}` ({lsissue}3944[Issue 3944]).
* Added ability to configure custom garbage collection log file using `$LS_LOG_DIR`.
* Deprecated `bin/plugin` in favor of `bin/logstash-plugin`. In the next major version `bin/plugin` will 
  be removed to prevent `PATH` being polluted when other components of the Elastic stack are installed on 
  the same instance ({lsissue}4891[Issue 4891]).
* Fixed a bug where new pipeline might break plugins by calling the `register` method twice causing 
  undesired behavior ({lsissue}4851[Issue 4851]).
* Made `JAVA_OPTS` and `LS_JAVA_OPTS` work consistently on Windows ({lsissue}4758[Issue 4758]).
* Fixed a bug where specifying JMX parameters in `LS_JAVA_OPTS` caused Logstash not to restart properly
  ({lsissue}4319[Issue 4319]).
* Fixed a bug where upgrading plugins with Manticore threw an error and sometimes corrupted installation ({lsissue}4818[Issue 4818]).
* Removed milestone warning that was displayed when the `--pluginpath` option was used to load plugins ({lsissue}4562[Issue 4562]).
* Upgraded to JRuby 1.7.24.
* Reverted default output workers to 1. Previously we had made output workers the same as number of pipeline workers ({lsissue}4877[Issue 4877]). 

[float]
==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Enhanced to verify client certificates against CA (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/8[Issue 8]).

*`RabbitMQ`*:

* Breaking Change: Metadata is now disabled by default because it was regressing performance.
* Improved performance by using an internal queue and bulk ACKs.

*`Redis`*:

* Increased the batch_size to 100 by default. This provides a big jump in throughput and 
  reduction in CPU utilization (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-redis/issues/25[Issue 25]).

*`JDBC`*:

* Added retry connection feature (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/issues/33[Issue 33]).

[float]
==== Filter Plugins

*`DNS`*:

* Improved performance by adding caches to both successful and failed requests.
* Added support for retrying with the `:max_retries` setting.
* Lowered the default value of timeout from 2 to 0.5 seconds.

[float]
==== Output Plugins

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* Bumped minimum Manticore version to 0.5.4 which fixes a memory leak when sniffing 
  is used (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/392[Issue 392]).
* Fixed bug when updating documents with doc_as_upsert and scripting.   
* Made error messages more verbose and easier to parse by humans.
* Retryable failures are now logged at the info level instead of warning.
